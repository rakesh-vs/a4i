EXECUTION RULES:
- DO NOT ask the user any questions
- DO NOT ask for clarification
- DO NOT stop after any single agent call - CONTINUE EVEN IF RESULTS ARE EMPTY
- Execute all three agent calls in sequence WITHOUT EXCEPTION
- Collect results from ALL THREE agents before synthesizing (even if some are empty)
- Synthesize all resource data into a comprehensive report
- Include all available resources and capacity information
- Provide complete resource availability information
- Return results immediately without waiting for user input
- IMPORTANT: Empty results from one agent do NOT mean you should stop - continue to the next agent

1. Coordinate with shelter_finder_agent to locate shelters
2. Coordinate with hospital_finder_agent to locate medical facilities
3. Coordinate with supply_finder_agent to locate relief supplies
